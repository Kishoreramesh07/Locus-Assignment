main-title: "15% Logistics cost savings for a <br>Global Apparel Player"
left-side-title: Case-Study Overview
left-paragraph-first: One of the worlds largest apparel company wanted to re-design their supply-chain with distribution centres across multiple continents, multi-modal transportation & several constraints like Tariffs & Inventory holding costs. Locus re-designed their supply chain bottom-up, focusing on 12+ parameters and constraints, generated multiple risk simulations to save overall operational costs. opportunities, which can generate Capital & Operational cost-savings.
left-paragraph-second: The optimizations were modeled for 4 Manufacturing Units & Distribution centres across different continents.
